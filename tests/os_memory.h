// `os_memory.c` is the in-memory implementation of `src/runtime/os.h`. A unit test linking it
// builds its fixture tree with the functions below and passes the host to the code under test,
// which then reads, walks, stats and writes that tree as it would the disk. Nothing touches the
// filesystem, so a test needs no temporary directory, no cleanup, and no change of working
// directory.
//
// The tree models what the build can observe of a POSIX filesystem: directories, regular files,
// hard links (two entries naming one file, so one identity), and symlinks with relative or absolute
// targets, followed on every path component and reported as `ELOOP` past as many expansions as the
// kernel follows, 32 on macOS and 40 on Linux. A relative path and an absolute one name the same
// tree, whose root is also the working directory. Failures the tree cannot produce by its shape,
// such as `EACCES`, are injected with `os_memory_fail`.
//
// A path ending in `/` must name a directory, and a listing comes newest entry first, an order
// unlike the one a test builds its tree in. Each operation the code under test calls produces the
// message the POSIX implementation would for the same situation, so a test written against this
// host asserts the text a user sees. `src/runtime/test_os.c` runs the same tests against both hosts
// to keep them in agreement: a property of the tree that a test relies on here needs a test there.
// An injected failure is not one of those properties. It is reported with the message the POSIX
// implementation gives for that `errno` value, and it matches every path below the one it names,
// which permission bits on a real tree do not always reproduce. Every operation holds the host's
// lock, so the parallel phases can share one host.
