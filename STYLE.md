# Style guide

This guide describes the target style for code owned by this repository. It is not a description of the current baseline: existing code that differs from this guide is a deviation to report or fix.

`.clang-format` owns mechanical layout. Do not restate whitespace, wrapping, indentation, brace-placement, or alignment rules here unless they affect meaning.

Vendored code under `vendor/` is out of scope.

## Influences

This guide is an amalgamation of ideas and conventions from the following resources:

- https://tigerstyle.dev/
- https://man.openbsd.org/style
- https://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst

## Simplicity

- Prefer simple code over clever code. Make the common path obvious.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Keep each function at one level of abstraction. A high-level function should read as a sequence of sibling operations at the same level of detail.
- Avoid dense expressions with hidden side effects.
- Keep structure definitions focused on the data model.
- Encode repetitive policy as data when it makes the program simpler.
- Prefer simple data structures until measured requirements justify more.
- Do not optimize speculatively. Measure first, then optimize the part that dominates.

## Readability

- Sort functions for reader flow. High-level orchestration functions should appear before lower-level mechanics when forward declarations make that practical.
- Keep tightly related helpers near each other. For mutually recursive functions, place the group together with the minimum forward declarations needed.
- In implementation files, use this order: includes, file-local types and constants, required forward declarations, exported functions in header order, then static helpers grouped by the exported or high-level function they support.
- In unit tests, use this order: shared helpers, common successful behavior, variants and edge cases, then rejection or failure cases.

## Headers

- Keep headers self-contained and minimal.
- Name include guards `SOSIG_<FILE>_H`, such as `SOSIG_CMD_BUILD_H` in `cmd_build.h`.
- Include the module's own header first in `.c` files.
- Prefer forward declarations for pointer-only dependencies where practical.
- Put implementation details in `.c` files. Keep file-local functions and data `static`.
- Expose the smallest interface needed by other modules.

## Names

- Prefer nouns that carry meaning and compose into derived identifiers.
- Do not abbreviate exported or non-trivial names. Reserve short names for tight local scope.
- Do not give one name multiple context-dependent meanings. Disambiguate instead.
- Use big-endian naming: put most significant word first, units and role suffixes last, so related names group together (`latency_ms_max` rather than `max_latency_ms`).
- Suffix a name by its role: `_path` (filesystem path), `_dir` (directory), `_name` (bare relative name), `_url` (URL), `_out` (output parameter).
- Pair a raw byte buffer with its length as `<x>`/`<x>_len`. Reserve `len` for a byte length and `count` for an element count, and keep the two distinct.
- Suffix a named byte-bound constant by what it measures: `_LEN_MAX` for a maximum content length that excludes the terminator (a caller adds room for it, as in `char slug[SLUG_LEN_MAX + 1]`), `_SIZE` for a fixed buffer's total byte count that includes the terminator (used directly as the array and `snprintf` size, as in `char err[ERROR_MESSAGE_SIZE]`), and `_CAPACITY_MIN` for the minimum starting capacity of a growable container that tracks fill separately (`STRING_BUFFER_CAPACITY_MIN` seeds the `capacity` field). Keep the three distinct.
- Name functions so that call sites read as clear statements. Avoid names that hide whether the return value indicates success, failure, truth, or ownership transfer.
- Name every exported function `<module>_<verb>`, where the module is the source file's base name: `site_config.c` defines `site_config_load`, and `fs.c` defines `fs_read_file`.
- The `<module>_<verb>` scheme names the exported surface only. A file-local (`static`) helper takes a short, readable name chosen to read well at its call site and does not carry the module prefix, which is reserved for exported functions.
- Directories classify modules by responsibility. Do not repeat a directory name in the symbol.
- When a function breaks an operation into steps and delegates each step to a lower-level helper that only it calls, prefix each such helper with the higher-level function's name to make the delegation chain visible (`frontmatter_parse_metadata` calls `frontmatter_parse_metadata_slug`). This applies only to step helpers dedicated to a single caller. A generic helper reused by several callers, or a self-contained routine that merely happens to have one caller today, takes a plain readable name instead.
- Name predicates and boolean fields, variables, and parameters using `is_*`, or `has_*` to describe what they answer, such as `is_valid` or `has_failed`.
- Use `snake_case` for functions, variables, fields, directories, and file-local helpers. Source files are named after the module or primary type (`site_config.c`), and live in the responsibility directory documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Use `PascalCase` for `struct` and `enum` tags, such as `SiteConfig`.
- Use `PascalCase` with an `Fn` suffix for callback typedefs, such as `PoolJobFn`.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE` for `enum` constants, prefixed by the concept they belong to, such as `CLI_COMMAND_BUILD`.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE` for a file-local constant that names a fixed literal value: a scalar, a fixed string, or a small list of default literals that stands in for a magic value, such as `SLUG_FALLBACK`, `FRONTMATTER_FENCE`, and `PERMALINK_DEFAULT`. Declare a constant string pointer as `static const char* const NAME` so neither the pointer nor the text can be rebound. Keep `snake_case` for read-only aggregate data that reads as a data structure rather than a named literal, such as a lookup or dispatch table of specs (`cli_commands`) or a singleton struct instance (`renderer`).
- Treat acronyms as words: `HtmlDocument` in `PascalCase`, `body_html` in `snake_case`.
- Avoid camelCase, Hungarian notation, and type-prefix naming.

## Types

- Use `bool` for real boolean state and predicates.
- Avoid transparent `typedef struct` aliases. Prefer named structs directly.
- Reserve typedefs for callback signatures or aliases that intentionally hide representation.
- Order struct fields to make ownership and invariants obvious: put lifecycle-owned backing storage first, keep pointer/count/capacity fields and value/presence-flag pairs adjacent in that order, keep discriminators before their variant payload, and put independent status flags after the data they describe. Do not reorder a struct when its layout is part of an external ABI, on-disk format, or positional initializer contract.

## Function signatures

- Choose a function's return type from its output shape, so call sites read the same everywhere:
  - A producer that allocates, creates, duplicates, looks up, or transforms into new storage returns the resulting pointer, or `NULL` on failure. This is the `malloc`/`strdup` convention.
  - An action that performs I/O, parses, writes, populates, appends, or runs returns `int`: `0` on success and `-1` on failure.
  - A predicate returns `bool` and is named `is_`, `has_`, or `valid_`.
  - An infallible query returns its value directly, and only when it genuinely cannot fail.
  - A lifecycle function such as `_init` or `_free` returns `void`.
- Use an output parameter (`_out`) only when the result cannot be folded into the return value: multiple outputs, populating a caller-owned struct, or a scalar whose whole range is valid so it has no spare sentinel.
- Order parameters as subject, inputs, producing context, outputs, then diagnostics: `(subject, inputs..., arena, *_out..., err, err_len)`. The subject is the object the function initializes, mutates, or appends to, and comes first. A producing arena that is not the subject sits just before the outputs. The `err`/`err_len` diagnostic pair is always last.
- Attach a diagnostic buffer (`char* err, size_t err_len`) to an action when the caller needs a message beyond success or failure. Format into it with the shared error helper.
- Pass a non-trivial struct by pointer and a scalar by value. Mark `const` every pointer parameter the function does not modify.
- Give a parameter the same name wherever it fills the same role, so `struct StringBuffer*` append targets are all `buffer`, not a mix of `buffer` and `buf`.

## Resources and ownership

- Make ownership transfer explicit in names, comments, or API contracts, using a consistent vocabulary.
- Keep cleanup symmetric. When a function owns several resources, prefer a single cleanup path over repeated partial cleanup blocks.
- Use `sizeof(*ptr)` allocation style so allocations follow the target type.

## Control flow

- State invariants positively and compare in the natural direction (`if (index < length)`), so the invariant-holds branch reads positively.
- Declare locals at the smallest scope. Introduce a variable where it is first used and do not keep it alive past its use.
- Compute or validate a value close to where it is used, to avoid place-of-check to place-of-use gaps.
- Choose the failure-handling shape from whether the function owns a resource that must be released before returning:
  - When the function owns nothing that needs cleanup, return early on the first failure (`if (step(...) != 0) { return -1; }`). Do not introduce a result variable to carry status past its use.
  - When the function owns a resource that must be released on every path, use a single cleanup path: initialize a result variable to the failure value (`int rc = -1;`), `goto cleanup` on each failure, set the success value only once the work is done, and release the resource under the `cleanup` label before returning.
  - When a single owned resource is threaded through a loop, carry the same result variable in the loop guard (`for (...; rc == 0 && ...;)`) so the loop short-circuits and falls through to the one cleanup path, rather than returning from inside the loop.
  - A short-lived local that only deduplicates one immediate check (a fallible call reached through two shapes, checked on the next line) is still an early return, not a status accumulator, and is fine.

## Limits

- Bound every buffer and loop. Prefer an explicit, named constant over a bare literal.
- Document the limit where it is defined. Enforce it with a `_Static_assert` or a runtime check where practical.
- On overflow, fail fast with a diagnostic that names the limit and the offending value, with the value last so a long value cannot truncate the limit off the end (`slug exceeds max slug length (250 bytes): 'x'`).

## Errors and diagnostics

- Check allocation, I/O, parsing, and formatting errors.
- Signal failure the same way across the whole codebase, following the return convention in [Function signatures](#function-signatures): a producer returns `NULL`, an action returns `-1`, and a predicate returns `false`. Where an external library uses a different convention, confine the translation to a single boundary function.
- Keep diagnostics lowercase and without trailing periods. A proper noun keeps its capital wherever it falls, including at the start (`Markdown input exceeds max Markdown input length (...)`), per the naming rule in [Comments](#comments).
- Relay a message that comes from the operating system or a vendored library exactly as that source spells it. The text a user reports has to be findable in the source that produced it, which a rewrite defeats.
- Quote literal names and user-visible values with single quotes, including paths, template names, config keys, frontmatter keys, and environment variables.
- Lead with the failed operation, then the relevant key when that value is bounded, then the cause, such as `config key 'feed_count' must be an integer` or `frontmatter key 'title' must be a string`. An unbounded value goes last instead, after the cause. That covers a content path, an output path, a template name, and a raw argument, so a pathological value truncates itself rather than the reason it was meant to explain. A filesystem path is never treated as bounded, even when every current caller passes a literal: name the subject in prose and let the path trail, as in `failed to read config: No such file or directory ('sosig.toml')`. What a caller happens to pass today is not a bound the message can rely on.
- Distinguish absent required keys from wrong types: use `missing required ... key` for absence and `... key 'name' must be ...` for invalid values.
- Trail a value in one of three shapes, chosen by the value's role, and do not mix them. Use `: '<value>'` for the value that broke the rule, so the message reads as a judgment of it (`slug exceeds max slug length (250 bytes) at 252 bytes: 'x'`). Use `('<path>')` for the path an operation targeted when the cause came from somewhere else, such as `errno` or a callee (`failed to read template: No such file or directory ('templates/x.html')`). Use `(in '<file>')` for the file a failure was located inside (`invalid tag at line 3, column 5 (in 'partials/card.html')`). Where a value fills some other role, name that role in words rather than reaching for a bare parenthesis: `(for '<source>', to '<destination>')` when there are two, and `(while rendering '<entry>')` when the failure is not in the file being named. A value that reads as part of the sentence stays in the sentence (`config key 'title' must be a string`). These shapes govern only a value appended after the cause.

## Comments

- Prefer clear code over comments. Do not explain how code works. Rewrite the code to be self-evident instead.
- Use `/** ... */` documentation comments for declarations: functions, types, fields, enum values, named constants, and other declarations whose purpose or contract needs explanation. Use `//` comments for implementation notes, including multi-line notes. Syntax communicates the comment's role, not its length or the declaration's visibility.
- Use comments to explain what a block is for, why it exists, or what constraints it must preserve.
- Use comments for invariants, ownership, protocols, non-obvious algorithms, compatibility constraints, and surprising decisions.
- Keep comments accurate and close to the code they explain. Remove stale comments when changing code.
- Comment on the code as it stands, not on how it got there. A comment narrating its own edit history, or arguing with a decision no longer in the tree, gives a reader nothing to act on. State the reason the code holds today. This applies to a documentation comment as much as to an implementation comment. A pointer to planned work is not history, so a comment explaining why something exists ahead of its first use is fine.
- Write comments as prose: full sentences, capitalized, ending with a period. A trailing end-of-line comment may be a lowercase phrase without punctuation.
- Capitalize language and format names wherever they are prose, including inside a diagnostic (`failed to render Markdown`, `frontmatter key 'date' must be a TOML date/datetime`). A name is a name, and lowercasing it makes it harder to recognize and to search for. Identifiers, filenames, and a library's own spelling of itself stay lowercase, because there the text is the token rather than the name (`markdown_to_html`, `formats/markdown.c`, `md4c`, `mustache4c`, `tomlc17`, `.md`).
- Quote literal paths, filenames, directory names, template names, and config keys with backticks, the same as code identifiers in Doxygen blocks.

## Function documentation

- Document every function with a Doxygen block comment (`/** ... */`) so a caller never has to read the body to learn what an argument means or what the return value signals.
- Place the block on the function's declaration: in the header for an exported function, on the file-local forward declaration for a static function that has one, or immediately above the definition for a static function or `main` with no separate declaration. Write the contract once. Do not repeat the block on both the declaration and the definition.
- Open the block with an `@brief` line stating what the function does in the third-person present ("Loads the site configuration.", "Appends a single byte."). Keep the voice consistent across the codebase.
- Give one `@param` line per parameter, naming what it holds and any contract the caller must honor: ownership, units, valid range, and whether `NULL` is accepted. For an `_out` parameter, describe what is written and when.
- Give an `@return` line whenever the function returns a value. Name the success value and every failure sentinel, following the return conventions in [Function signatures](#function-signatures): a producer returns the new pointer or `NULL`, an action returns `0` or `-1`, a predicate returns `true` or `false`. Omit `@return` only for a function returning `void`.
- Keep the block to the function's contract. A definition may still carry `//` comments that explain implementation, invariants, or surprising decisions, per [Comments](#comments).

## Tests

- Assert the exact expected value whenever the output is deterministic. Reserve a substring check for cases where an exact match would be brittle rather than strict: long prose such as help text, output from a vendored library already covered by the golden diff, or a string embedding a temporary directory.
- When a substring check is the right tool, make the needle the complete claim. A needle that is one word of a diagnostic, such as `strstr(err, "title")`, passes for every message mentioning that word, including the message for a different failure.
- Assert the diagnostic of every failure, not just the non-zero return. A bare `!= 0` cannot tell the failure under test from an unrelated one, and keeps passing when a later change moves the failure to another phase.
- Keep the distinctions required by [Errors and diagnostics](#errors-and-diagnostics) visible to the tests: a missing key and a wrong-typed key must fail different assertions, not the same loose one.
- Derive an expected limit from its named constant rather than repeating the literal. Spell out a literal only when the constant is file-local, and note that changing it must update the test.
- Where correct behavior must not depend on an unspecified detail, such as how `qsort` orders elements that compare equal, assert the same result for more than one input order.
- Do not restate golden-fixture coverage in a unit test. Note where the end-to-end assertion lives instead.
- Order tests as described in [Readability](#readability), and comment each with what it establishes rather than a restatement of its name. A test, and every shared helper in `tests/`, carries a `//` comment rather than a Doxygen block. [Function documentation](#function-documentation) governs `src/` only. A helper's comment may run to two or three lines where it has a real ownership rule, failure sentinel, or deliberate shortcut to record, but it never takes `@param` or `@return` tags.
- Guard a pointer from a standard-library allocation (`fopen`, `open_memstream`, `tmpfile`, `calloc`) with `TEST_ASSERT` followed by an explicit `if (ptr == NULL) return;`. The assert states the precondition and the `if` is what static analysis can actually follow: `TEST_ASSERT` hides its abort behind a call whose return value `cppcheck` cannot reason about, so without the `if` it reports `nullPointerOutOfResources` on the next use, and a cross-translation-unit variant in whichever `src/` function receives the pointer. The `if` body is unreachable and does not unwind. An aborted test leaves descriptors and allocations to process exit. Project allocators such as `arena_alloc` are not modeled as allocating by `cppcheck` and need no such guard.
