// Every function here, and every caller that threads a datum onward, takes `toml_datum_t` by value
// rather than by pointer, against the general rule that a non-trivial struct is passed by pointer.
// This is the tomlc17 boundary. `toml_get` returns a datum by value (see
// `vendor/tomlc17/tomlc17.h`), so the alternative is a local copy per call whose only purpose is to
// have an address to take. Matching the library's shape at its own boundary keeps the translation
// in one layer, which is where the codebase confines every other external convention. Do not spread
// the by-value habit to structs this repository owns.

/**
 * @brief Parses a TOML document, treating an allocation failure inside tomlc17 as out of memory and
 *        logging a parse error.
 *
 * This is the one entry point to the tomlc17 parser, so every caller gets the project's allocation
 * policy. tomlc17 allocates through `malloc` and reports a failed allocation as a parse error. The
 * first call installs an allocator that calls `os_oom` instead, so a returned error is always a
 * problem with the document. The installation happens once, under `pthread_once`, which makes the
 * call safe from concurrent pool jobs.
 *
 * This is also where tomlc17's `ok` flag becomes the project's `0`/`-1`: a parse error is logged
 * against `file_path` and its result is released here, so a caller sees either a result to read or
 * nothing to free.
 *
 * tomlc17 reads exactly `document.len` bytes and needs no terminator. It takes the length as an
 * `int`, so the document must be no longer than `INT_MAX` bytes, which every caller's input limit
 * guarantees.
 *
 * @param document   Document bytes. `data` must not be `NULL`.
 * @param file_path  File the document came from, named in the parse error.
 * @param parsed_out Receives the parse result on success, which the caller must pass to `toml_free`
 *                   exactly once. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param operation  What failed, the message's prefix, such as `failed to parse config`.
 * @param log        Log that receives the parse error. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @return `0` on success, or `-1` on a parse error.
