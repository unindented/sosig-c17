/**
 * @brief Rejects an `output_dir` at or below `content_dir` or `templates_dir`, whether or not it
 *        exists yet.
 *
 * A build runs this before it walks an input tree or creates anything. An `output_dir` inside a
 * root puts every output inside it, where the next build would read them back as inputs, so this
 * one answer covers every output at once. Each root is compared by `(device, inode)` against the
 * nearest existing ancestor of `output_dir` and each of that directory's physical ancestors, so an
 * alternate spelling of a root, a symlinked root, and a symlink on the way to `output_dir` are all
 * caught, and a sibling such as `contentx` is not. The nearest existing ancestor is `output_dir`
 * itself once it exists, so the answer does not depend on whether an earlier build created it. A
 * root that does not exist holds nothing to protect and is skipped.
 *
 * @param site_config Configuration supplying `content_dir`, `output_dir`, and `templates_dir`. Must
 *                    not be `NULL`.
 * @param err         Destination buffer for a failure diagnostic.
 * @param err_len     Size of `err` in bytes.

 *         failure.

/**
 * @brief Records every intended output path in the build manifest, rejecting duplicates and any
 *        output that would land inside a build input tree or overwrite a build input file.
 *
 * Registers content entry and template output paths before writing any file, so it catches a
 * collision between two producers up front. It rejects four kinds of collision:
 * - an output path at or below `content_dir` or `templates_dir`
 * - an output path that names a build input
 * - two producers that claim one output path, compared after folding ASCII case
 * - an output path that is a `/`-delimited directory prefix of another output path
 *
 * The first case catches an output that would be read back as an input without overwriting one: a
 * new Markdown file below `content_dir` is parsed as a source by the next build, and a new file
 * below `templates_dir` can be read as a partial by the render of this same build. This runs
 * `manifest_builder_check_output_dir` itself first, so an `output_dir` inside a root is rejected
 * even when the caller skipped the early check, and then compares each root by `(device, inode)`
 * against each existing directory between `output_dir` and the output. That catches a symlink
 * inside `output_dir` that leads into a root. A root that does not exist holds nothing to protect
 * and is skipped.
 *
 * The last case requires one path to be both a file and a directory.
 * `manifest_find_prefix_collision` checks for it after all paths are recorded. Both path checks
 * fold ASCII `A-Z` to `a-z`, so `About/index.html` and `about/index.html` are one output, as they
 * are on a case-insensitive filesystem such as the macOS default. Every other byte compares
 * exactly.
 *
 * The input-file check compares filesystem identity, not path text, because the two spellings need
 * not match: `output_dir = "."` with a template named `sosig.toml` produces `./sosig.toml` against
 * the config path `sosig.toml`. Comparing `(device, inode)` also rejects a collision created by a
 * symlink, a hard link, or a case-insensitive filesystem. It claims the config, every discovered
 * source, and every file below `templates_dir`, so it still protects an input that a link places
 * outside both roots. The template walk leaves out `output_dir`, so a generated file that a symlink
 * inside `templates_dir` reaches is not mistaken for a template. A missing `templates_dir` claims
 * nothing, because it holds no file to overwrite. A full build never gets here with one: loading
 * the build inputs already rejects it.
 *
 * @param manifest            Manifest that receives the output paths. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param site_config         Configuration supplying `content_dir`, `output_dir`, `templates_dir`
 *                            and the template lists. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param config_path         Path the configuration itself was loaded from. Claimed as an input
 *                            like any other, so a build cannot overwrite the file that configured
 *                            it. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param source_paths        Every discovered content source path, drafts included, whose files
 *                            must not be overwritten. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param content_entries     Rendered non-draft content entries whose output paths, each joined
 *                            onto `output_dir`, are recorded. May be `NULL` only when
 *                            `content_entry_count` is 0.
 * @param content_entry_count Number of entries in `content_entries`.
 * @param err                 Destination buffer for a failure diagnostic.
 * @param err_len             Size of `err` in bytes.
 * @return `0` when every output path is unique, stays out of both input trees, overwrites no input,
 *         and nests under no other, or `-1` on an output inside an input tree, a duplicate, a
 *         prefix collision, an input overwrite, an oversize template path, a failed template walk,
 *         or an allocation failure.
