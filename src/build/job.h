/**
 * @brief Runs one parallel phase, reports progress, and collects its diagnostics.
 *
 * Gives each job a log of its own, runs every index through the worker pool, and then appends the
 * failed jobs' logs to `log` in job order, so the report is the same however the jobs were
 * scheduled. A job whose messages repeat an earlier job's is counted but not printed again, because
 * one systematic failure, such as a template that cannot parse, fails every job alike. Each job may
 * name itself at the end of each of its lines, after `attribution`, so the comparison stops there:
 * `x (while rendering 'a')` repeats `x (while rendering 'b')`. At most `JOB_ERROR_REPORT_COUNT_MAX`
 * jobs are printed, followed by a count of the remaining failures. Every job's errors count in
 * `log->errors`, printed or not.
 *
 * @param job_count     Number of job indexes to run. Must not be negative. `0` runs nothing and
 *                      succeeds.
 * @param worker_count  Requested worker threads, as for `pool_run`. Must be positive.
 * @param worker_arenas One `JobArenas` per requested worker, `worker_count` of them. Each job gets
 *                      the entry for the worker running it. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param job_fn        Callback invoked for each index, concurrently from several threads, so it
 *                      must be thread-safe. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param userdata      Opaque pointer forwarded to every `job_fn` call.
 * @param phase_label   Phase name leading each progress line, and named when no worker can start or
 *                      the run fails without a diagnostic.
 * @param attribution   Text that starts the job's own name at the end of a line, such as
 *                      ` (while rendering '`, or empty when a job's lines carry none. A line
 *                      compares only up to its last `attribution`.
 * @param is_verbose    Whether each finished job prints a progress line to `stderr`.
 * @param os            Host the progress line is printed on, by every worker at once. Must not be
 *                      `NULL`.
 * @param scratch       Arena for the jobs' logs and the run's thread bookkeeping, released when the
 *                      run returns. One share of it per worker holds the logs of that worker's
 *                      jobs. Must not overlap any of `worker_arenas` or `log`'s arena.
 * @param log           Log that receives the collected errors. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @return `0` when every job succeeded, or `-1` when a job failed or the worker pool could not
 *         start.
