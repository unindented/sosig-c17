// Bounds on one template render. There are three independent failure modes, so three limits, each
// enforced at the one place that can observe it. Each limit names what it bounds: the expansion
// count terminates partial recursion, the output length bounds the output buffer, and the distinct
// partial count bounds the compiled-partial cache. All three bound a single render, and renders run
// `worker_count`-wide, so several per-render costs can be live at once. That scaling is close to
// linear. On an 8-entry runaway build at three names per expansion, peak resident memory rose from
// 63 MB with one worker to 397 MB with eight. Read the per-render figures below as costs that
// `worker_count` concurrent runaway renders multiply.
//
// None of the three bounds the render's total memory. Templates are trusted input, like the config.
// `node_alloc` puts a node in the per-render arena for every name resolution, and a section nested
// inside another resolves its names once per iteration of every enclosing section without touching
// the expansion counter. A template's own nested iteration therefore uses memory proportional to
// the iterations it asks for. Over 20 entries, `{{#tags}}{{/tags}}` inside `{{#content_entries}}`
// nested five deep renders a one-byte page at 322 MB peak resident memory, and six deep at 6.4 GB.
//
// Termination: mustache4c expands partials iteratively through its own stack and exposes no nesting
// depth, but it calls the partial resolver once per expansion, cache hits included. Expansions are
// what can be counted, and counting them stops a partial that includes itself. A legitimate render
// costs one expansion per partial reference per entry, so an aggregate over 10,000 entries
// referencing ten partials each costs 100,000. The bound sits three times above that.
//
// The margin is three rather than ten because of what an expansion costs. mustache4c's own stack is
// 24 bytes per expansion: three `uintptr_t` pushes, at `mustache.c:1119`, heap-backed rather than
// thread stack. That is the smaller term. The larger one is this file's nodes, which the arena
// keeps until the render ends, and nothing bounds names-per-expansion. A template referencing nine
// names inside a self-including partial resolves nine nodes per expansion, so a runaway render's
// memory is `expansions × names`, not `expansions`. The bound has to be set against the product.
//
// These figures are peak resident memory of a whole `sosig build` measured at this bound, one
// entry, one worker, release build: 10 MB for a bare `{{>loop}}`, 53 MB at three names, 111 MB at
// nine, scaling linearly in names from there. The nodes cannot be shared or interned to avoid this.
// See `node_alloc`, which states the vendored contract requiring pointer-unique nodes. Lowering the
// count further would start to reject the legitimate case above. A section iterating inside the
// recursive partial multiplies each expansion's cost by its iteration count, which no limit here
// bounds.
//
// Output: escaping expands one byte into as much as a six-byte entity, so the check bounds
// accumulated output after each append rather than from the incoming chunk length. This bounds the
// output buffer, not the render's other allocations. It is the only one of the three a legitimate
// site can reach, so the bound targets that case rather than a runaway one. An aggregate embedding
// every entry's full body costs `entry_count * body_size`, which for 10,000 entries at ~6.7 KB is
// 64 MB, so the bound sits four times above the largest site this tool is meant for. The output
// buffer grows in place in the caller's arena and doubles, so a render that reaches the bound
// reserves up to twice it before failing. Resident memory stays lower, because the doubled capacity
// is never written. Reaching the bound costs that many bytes, so `template_render_file_limited`
// takes the bound as a parameter, and the test that asserts its diagnostic passes a smaller one.
//
// Capacity: the compiled-partial cache is a fixed array, so its length bounds the distinct partial
// count and with it the cache. This one limits real templates, not runaway ones. A cycle cannot
// inflate the distinct-name count, because the cache returns hits.
//
// `RENDER_OUTPUT_LEN_MAX` and `TEMPLATE_FILE_LEN_MAX` are declared in `template.h`, because the
// build sizes its perms from the first and the tests read the second.
