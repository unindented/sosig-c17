 * it. If unclaimed, that output would overwrite the project's configuration. The build would still
 * report success.
 *
 * The whole template tree is claimed rather than the configured template names, because partials
 * are inputs too. `template.c` resolves them lazily during the render, from names that only appear
 * inside a template's bytes, so no pass that runs before the first write can enumerate the partials
 * a build will read. Claiming every file below `templates_dir` covers them without that list, so an
 * output path aimed inside `templates_dir/partials/` is rejected. It also covers every configured
 * template, the content template, aggregate and feed templates, and entry overrides alike, because
 * each is a safe relative name joined below `templates_dir`.
 *
 * This skips a path with no identity rather than refusing it. A missing configuration file or
