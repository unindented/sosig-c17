 * `manifest_add` reports a path already present as a duplicate and leaves the manifest unchanged.
 *
 * The manifest keeps its entries in insertion order, the order `manifest_next_output_path` visits
 * them in.
 *
 * Duplicate means equal after folding ASCII `A-Z` to `a-z`, so `About/index.html` and
 * `about/index.html` collide on every platform, as they would on a case-insensitive filesystem.
 * Every other byte compares exactly: the manifest does not attempt locale-dependent folding or
 * Unicode normalization. A `0` is therefore not proof that the path can be created: two outputs
 * where one is a `/`-delimited prefix of the other, like a file `a/b` beside `a/b/c`, are each
 * recorded here yet still collide on disk. `manifest_find_prefix_collision` catches that pair once
 * every path is recorded.

 * @param arena                     Arena that owns the manifest's entries and copies. Every add to
 *                                  one manifest must use the same arena. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param source_label_existing_out Receives the label of the earlier claim on `-1`. Ignored when
 *                                  `NULL`. The label is borrowed from the manifest and lives as
