 * The manifest copies both strings into `arena`, so the arguments need not outlive the call.
 * `manifest_add` reports a path already present as a duplicate and leaves the manifest unchanged.
 *
 * The manifest appends entries in insertion order, but that order is not reachable from outside
 * this module. `struct ManifestEntry` is incomplete and no accessor exposes it. Treat it as an
 * implementation property rather than part of this contract until one exists.
 *
 * Duplicate means equal after folding ASCII `A-Z` to `a-z`, so `About/index.html` and
 * `about/index.html` collide on every platform, as they would on a case-insensitive filesystem.
 * Every other byte compares exactly: the manifest does not attempt locale-dependent folding or
 * Unicode normalization. A `0` is therefore not proof that the path can be created: two outputs
 * where one is a `/`-delimited prefix of the other, like a file `a/b` beside `a/b/c`, are each
 * recorded here yet still collide on disk. `manifest_find_prefix_collision` catches that pair once
 * every path is recorded.

 * @param output_path               Filesystem output path to record.
 * @param source_label              Diagnostic label for the source producing `output_path`.
 * @param arena                     Arena that owns the manifest's entries and copies. Every add to
 *                                  one manifest must use the same arena. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param source_label_existing_out Receives the label of the earlier claim on `-1`. Ignored when
 *                                  `NULL`. The label is borrowed from the manifest and lives as
 *                                  long as `arena`.
 * @return `0` when the path was recorded, or `-1` when it was already claimed and the manifest is

 * @brief Finds the next recorded output path that has a `/`-delimited prefix recorded as another.
 *
 * `manifest_add` rejects only paths equal under ASCII case folding. This catches the other way two
 * outputs collide on disk: a file path that is also a directory prefix of a second output, like
 * `a/b` beside `a/b/c`. The prefix match folds ASCII case the same way, so `Blog/Feed` collides
 * with `blog/feed/index.html`. Run it after every output path is recorded. It examines each path's
 * ancestor prefixes, so it reports such a pair whichever order the two were added in.
 *
 * Each call resumes after the descendant of the pair `collision` holds, so a loop that starts from
 * a zeroed `collision` and calls this until it returns `false` visits every path that nests under
 * another once, paired with its shortest recorded ancestor.
 *
 * The reported strings are borrowed from the manifest and live as long as its arena.
 *
 * @param manifest  Manifest to scan. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param collision The pair the previous call found, or zeroed for the first call. Receives the
 *                  next pair on a hit, and is untouched on a miss. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @return `true` and fills `collision` when another prefix collision exists, or `false` when every
 *         remaining recorded path can coexist on disk.
