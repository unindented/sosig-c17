 * arguments). It leaves `argv[0]` untouched.
 *
 * `options` retains no pointer into `argv`. `error_message` is a fixed inline buffer holding a
 * formatted copy, so the result stays valid however the caller later reorders or overwrites `argv`.
 * That is also why it is an array rather than a `const char*`. A later change to avoid the 512-byte
