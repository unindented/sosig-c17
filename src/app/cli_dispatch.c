/**
 * @brief Maps a printer's result to an exit code, reporting the stream's own reason on failure.
 *
 * On failure, reports the stream's `errno` rather than only returning failure. `cli_dispatch` uses
 * the reason to distinguish output failures from command failures.
 *
 * A closed stdout pipe looks like a common path into this function, but it usually is not. With the
 * default `SIGPIPE` disposition, the process dies of signal 13 inside `fflush` and never reaches
 * here. A broken-pipe diagnostic appears only when the caller ignored `SIGPIPE` and that
 * disposition survived `exec`.
 *
 * Reading `errno` after the printer returns is valid by contract. `cli_print_version` and
 * `cli_print_usage` both document that they set it. If the stream had latched an error earlier and
 * the original `errno` may have been overwritten, they set `EIO` instead. `cmd_config_run` relays
 * `site_config_print` the same way.
 *
 * @param print_rc Result of the printer call.
 * @param subject  What was being written, named in the diagnostic, such as `version` or `usage`.
 *                 Must not be `NULL`.
 * @return `EXIT_CODE_OK` when `print_rc` is 0, or `EXIT_CODE_FAILURE` after reporting the reason.
