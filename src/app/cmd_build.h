 * worker, for fewer workers when an address-space limit refuses the block, runs
 * `cmd_build_execute`, and releases the block after the build. On failure it prints the build's log
 * to `stderr` exactly once, every error on its own line. Progress lines emitted under verbose mode
 * are status, not diagnostics. If the build runs out of memory, the program's `os_oom` prints the
 * log instead.
 *
 * @param options Build knobs such as worker count and verbosity. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param os      Host the build reads, writes, and prints its status lines and log on. Must not be
 *                `NULL`.

/**
 * @brief Runs the build pipeline, collecting every error into a log.
 *
 * Performs no error printing itself so callers can inspect the log directly. `cmd_build_run` is the
 * boundary that prints it. Until the first write, the build keeps going after an error wherever the
 * next phase still has something to check, so one run reports every bad config key, every source
 * that does not parse, and every output collision, in that order, sources in walk order. It stops
 * before writing anything if any error was recorded. A dry run runs the same phases, changes
 * nothing under `output_dir`, and prints to `stdout` what it would have written, kept, and removed.
 *
 * The main thread's data that outlives a phase, from the configuration and the source paths to the
 * manifest, goes in `perm`, and its temporaries and a parallel phase's job logs in `scratch`. Each
 * worker allocates only from its own `worker_arenas` entry. A build whose data outgrows an arena
 * ends in `os_oom`.
 *
 * @param options       Build knobs. Its worker count must be positive. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param worker_arenas One perm and one scratch per worker, `options->worker_count` of them. Must
 *                      not be `NULL`.
 * @param os            Host every phase reads from and writes to, and status lines print on. Must
 *                      not be `NULL`.
 * @param perm          The main thread's perm. The build uses it up, and nothing it allocates
 *                      outlives the call.
 * @param scratch       The main thread's scratch.
 * @param log           Log that receives every error. Its arena must not overlap the other arenas,
 *                      because the phases copy arenas by value while they log. Left empty on
 *                      success. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @return `0` on a complete build, or `-1` on any error, with every error in `log`.
