// Every operation the build performs on the host goes through the functions below, and nothing else
// in `src/` makes a system call on a path. Each is declared once here and defined by exactly one
// implementation per executable, chosen when it is linked, as `_ssg` does with `main_posix.cpp` and
// `main_test.cpp`:
//
// - `runtime/fs.c` is the POSIX implementation, which the `sosig` executable and every unit test
//   registered without `OS memory` link (`cmake/sosig_testing.cmake` says which tests those are and
//   why).
// - `tests/os_memory.c` is an in-memory implementation, which the unit tests registered with
//   `OS memory` link, so they build their trees without touching the disk.
//
// A link-time choice needs no table of function pointers, and the build never needs two
// implementations in one process. `struct Os` is defined by the implementation, so each carries its
// own state: none for POSIX, the whole tree for the in-memory one.
//
// `os_oom`, the remaining member of the interface, is declared in `shared/arena.h`, because the
// arena calls it. It is not defined here but by each program: `app/main.c` for the executable and
// `tests/test_support.c` for every unit test, whichever implementation it links.
//
// Every path is a `struct Str`. A path the POSIX system could not take whole fails rather than
// naming some other file: one of `PATH_MAX` bytes or more fails as `ENAMETOOLONG`, as the system
// would fail it, and one holding a `NUL` byte fails as `EINVAL`, because the system would read only
// the bytes before it. A path that ends in `/` must name a directory, so a read, a listing or a
// `stat` of one that names anything else fails as `ENOTDIR`, even on a system that would resolve
// `link/` to the file `link` points to.
//
// Every operation below that can fail and takes a `log` also takes the caller's `operation`, such
// as `failed to read config`, and records one error in `log` that leads with it and then gives the
// cause, as in `failed to read config: No such file or directory ('sosig.toml')`. The caller owns
// the operation and its attribution, because one failed `os_write` is
// `failed to write template output` from the aggregate phase and something else from the page
// phase, while only the implementation knows which path failed: the file itself, or a directory
// partway through a `mkdir -p`. First-party causes are lowercase. Operating-system messages keep
// their spelling.
