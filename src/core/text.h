/**
 * @brief Converts arbitrary text to a lowercase, URL-safe slug in arena-owned storage.
 *
 * Runs of ASCII non-alphanumeric bytes collapse to single dashes. It trims leading and trailing
 * dashes. It folds a non-ASCII byte to two lowercase hex digits, so names that differ only outside
 * ASCII still yield distinct slugs. Text that yields no usable characters falls back to the literal
 * `untitled`.
 *
 * Takes a length so a caller can slugify a borrowed slice of a larger buffer, such as one path
 * segment, without copying it out first. The returned slug is a terminated owned string either way.
 *
 * Reports the slug's length rather than leaving the caller to recover it with `strlen`. Both
 * callers need it: one to check it against `SLUG_LEN_MAX`, one to size the buffer several slugs are
 * joined into. This function already knows it exactly, so handing it back keeps every caller
 * reading that length instead of a second derivation that has to agree with it.
 *
 * @param text         Source bytes to slugify. Must hold at least `text_len` bytes. Must not be
 *                     `NULL`.
 * @param text_len     Number of bytes to slugify.
 * @param arena        Arena that owns the returned slug. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @param slug_len_out Receives the slug's length in bytes, excluding the terminator. Written only
 *                     on success. Must not be `NULL`.
 * @return Terminated slug owned by the arena, or `NULL` on an oversize input or allocation failure.
