# `OS` names the implementation of `src/runtime/os.h` the test links: `posix` (the default) or
# `memory` for the in-memory host in `tests/os_memory.c`. Every test registered without `OS memory`
# links the POSIX host: the tests that need the real host, such as the POSIX layer's own tests and
# the test-support test; the suites written before the in-memory host, which stay on it until they
# are converted; and the tests that reach no host. New tests use the in-memory host. A test that
# links the in-memory host is compiled with `SOSIG_TEST_OS_MEMORY` set to 1. `NAME` names the
# executable and the test when one source builds more than one, as the `os` contract tests do. It
# defaults to `module`.
